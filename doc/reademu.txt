                           =========================

AdvanceMAME/MESS are unofficial MAME/MESS versions with an
advanced video support for helping the use with TVs, Arcade
monitors, PC monitors and LCD screens.

They run in Linux, Mac OS X, DOS, Windows and in all the other
platforms supported by the SDL library.

The official site of AdvanceMAME/MESS is :

    http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/

The main difference compared with the official emulators is that
the Advance versions are able to program directly the video board
to always get a video mode with the correct size and frequency.

Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which
doesn't require any stretching or other unneeded effects to match the
original arcade display.

The direct video board programming is fully supported in Linux
and DOS. It's partially supported in Windows. It isn't supported in
Mac OS X and other platforms.
