  This interface doesn't have applied the same video
  effects of the game, it isn't limited on the game area, it
  isn't recorded on video clips and you can customize the font.

  enabled and the `event.dat' file is missing or it doesn't contain
  information of the game. You can disable it with the option
  `misc_safequit no'.

  unified in `scale', `lq' and `hq'. The correct scale
  factor if automatically detected from the video mode size.

  different configuration for vertical and horizontal
  games. If you have a rotating monitor, you can now
  always configure the correct orientation.
* The `display_rotate auto' option now selects always the
  `blit' rotation. The reason of this change is that
  the `core' rotation will be completely removed on the
  next MAME version (0.62).
  On monoprocessor machines this may result in a
  sensible slowdown on some games. Instead, on SMP
  (multiprocessor) machines all these games are now
  faster because the rotation is done in the parallel

ADVANCEMAME VERSION 0.53.0 2001/08
==================================

* Major release with BIG changes. This should be considered
  an alpha version.
* Kept the support for 8 bit modes. You can still use 8 bit
  modes for games with less than 256 colors without
  problems. You can also use 8 bit modes for all the other
  games but you lose in color precision.
* The modeline format is changed. The new format is independent
  of the video driver and of video board. The modelines
  can now be exchanged between users.
* Added a new set of video drivers called `svgaline' from
  the Linux SVGALIB library. These drivers overperform
  the old `vbeline' drivers. The old drivers are still
  supported anyway.
  These drivers are completely independent of the underline
  VBE BIOS. You don't need the SDD utility anymore.
* Added support for 32 bit depth.
* The sources are now completely independent from the MAMEDOS
  sources. They stay in a new directory called `advance'.
  Check the updated `build.txt' to compile.
* The configuration file is now named like the executable.
  For example "mamepp.exe" checks for "mamepp.cfg".
* Added the `videodepth' option to control the bit depth of the
  video mode used. The old `depth' option is still present
  but control only the internal size of the working MAME
  bitmap.
* Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
  `mame.cfg' file.
* Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.
* Removed all the -list* and -verify* options. These will may be
  added in a future version with an external utility.
  Only the -listinfo option is maintained.
* Updated the `mv' and `cfg' utility at the new features.
* Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
  board supported.
* The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if
  the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
  coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
  [Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]

  Something like 55-125 Hz.
* Added the `[config] magnify' option to suggest the use of
  a double resolution.

  how the auto video mode is chosen.
  If you get incorrect results try to delete them and
  restart with the default values.
* Renamed the option `video_factor_strecth' in `video_factor_aspect'.

  Use the mame.cfg `recordtime' option to limit the maximum
  record length in seconds.
* Corrected some color palette issues in the `vbe/vbeline' modes.
* Rewritten the choice of the best video mode. Now you can control
  the process with the new mame.cfg `video_factor_*' options.

* Added the option `[config] vsync_adjust'. If it's set to `yes'
  AND the `vsync' is enabled all the `vbeline' modes
  are adjusted to match the exact frame rate of the
  emulated game. This option makes sense only with a PC
  multisync monitor which can accept a wide range of
  vertical and horizontal frequencies.
  Try with :

    [config]
    vsync = yes
    vsync_adjust = yes

* Solved some bugs in the `r128' driver. Now working.
* Now `mame' doesn't add any default video modes if the list
  defined in the `mame.cfg' file is empty. You MUST use

  :[video]
  :hclock = 0
  :vclock = 0

  `,' (COMMA) and `.' (STOP) for preventing clash with the
  hotrod settings.

  problems with some NeoMagic cards (possible Segmentation
  fault)

  technical documentation of video stuffs
* Changed the display format of the video mode list in `mame'
* Updated a lot the file `mame.txt'

====================================

* Added `cirrus', `s3' and `matrox' video drivers
* Added the `-log' option at `mv'
* Added the `-nosound' option at `mv'

  disabled like the official mame. (auto->yes, missing->no)
* Added some new `vbeline' modes for PAL/NTSC
* Added the resize command with the CTRL+ARROW keys in the `mv'
  test screen

I am interested in functionality reports with these information:

"mv -log"  when you test (pressing ENTER) all the `vbeline'
video modes available.
3) The list of `vbeline' video modes that display incorrectly
