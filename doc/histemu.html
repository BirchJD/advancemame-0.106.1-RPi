Upgraded at the SVGALIB 1.9.15 library.
</li>
<li>
Added the `vertical' and `horizontal' sections on the
config file. With these sections you can have
different configuration for vertical and horizontal
games. If you have a rotating monitor, you can now
always configure the correct orientation.
</li>
<li>
The `display_rotate auto' option now selects always the
`blit' rotation. The reason of this change is that
the `core' rotation will be completely removed on the
next MAME version (0.62).
On monoprocessor machines this may result in a
sensible slowdown on some games. Instead, on SMP
(multiprocessor) machines all these games are now
faster because the rotation is done in the parallel
blit thread.

is not set all the files are read and written on the
PREFIX/share/advance directory.
</li>
<li>
Fixed a bug when forcing the use of the vbeline/3dfx driver.
</li>
<li>
Enabled the interlaced modes with the 3dfx svgalib driver.

<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.53.0 2001/08
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Major release with BIG changes. This should be considered
an alpha version.
</li>
<li>
Kept the support for 8 bit modes. You can still use 8 bit
modes for games with less than 256 colors without
problems. You can also use 8 bit modes for all the other
games but you lose in color precision.
</li>
<li>
The modeline format is changed. The new format is independent
of the video driver and of video board. The modelines
can now be exchanged between users.
</li>
<li>
Added a new set of video drivers called `svgaline' from
the Linux SVGALIB library. These drivers overperform
the old `vbeline' drivers. The old drivers are still
supported anyway.
These drivers are completely independent of the underline
VBE BIOS. You don't need the SDD utility anymore.
</li>
<li>
Added support for 32 bit depth.
</li>
<li>
The sources are now completely independent from the MAMEDOS
sources. They stay in a new directory called `advance'.
Check the updated `build.txt' to compile.
</li>
<li>
The configuration file is now named like the executable.
For example "mamepp.exe" checks for "mamepp.cfg".
</li>
<li>
Added the `videodepth' option to control the bit depth of the
video mode used. The old `depth' option is still present
but control only the internal size of the working MAME
bitmap.
</li>
<li>
Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
`mame.cfg' file.
</li>
<li>
Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.
</li>
<li>
Removed all the -list* and -verify* options. These will may be
added in a future version with an external utility.
Only the -listinfo option is maintained.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `mv' and `cfg' utility at the new features.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
board supported.
</li>
<li>
The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if
the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
[Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]
</li>
<li>
The `soundcard' option now uses text tag and not numbers.
The tags are :
auto - Automatic detection
sb - Sound Blaster
awe32 - Sound Blaster AWE 32 (probably the 'sb' driver is faster)
pas - Pro Audio Spectrum
gusmax - Gravis Ultrasound Max
gus - Gravis Ultrasound
wss - Windows Sound System
ess - Ensoniq Soundscape

</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.37b10.0 2000/12
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for Trident cards using the new video
driver of VSyncMAME written by Saka.
Use the "vbeline_driver=vbe3" option to revert to the
old behavior.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Added two new `turbostartupspeed' and `turbostartuptime' options to
speed up the game startup.
</li>
<li>
Added a new `turbo' button (num pad *) and a new option
`turbospeed' to speed up the game play
</li>
<li>
Added two new simple effects `filterx' and `filtery'
</li>
<li>
Changed the coinage support. Now it works for all
the games because it intercepts the coin keys and it
doesn't require the explicit driver support.
</li>
<li>
Corrected some garbage on video when using artworks
</li>
</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.37b9.0 2000/11
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Added the capability to save sound preview. Use `backspace' to start
and `enter' to stop the recording.
The file is saved in the `snap' directory in the `wav'
format. The frequency rate is the value specified
with the mame.cfg `samplerate' option.
Use the mame.cfg `recordtime' option to limit the maximum
record length in seconds.
</li>
<li>
Corrected some color palette issues in the `vbe/vbeline' modes.
</li>
<li>
Rewritten the choice of the best video mode. Now you can control
the process with the new mame.cfg `video_factor_*' options.
</li>
</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.37b8.0 2000/10

</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Corrected the aspect ratio of some vectors games.
</li>
<li>
Minor correction at the `vbe3' driver
</li>
<li>
Added the option `[config] vsync_adjust'. If it's set to `yes'
AND the `vsync' is enabled all the `vbeline' modes
are adjusted to match the exact frame rate of the
emulated game. This option makes sense only with a PC
multisync monitor which can accept a wide range of
vertical and horizontal frequencies.
Try with :
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"><tr><td width="5%"></td><td width="95%">
<pre>
[config]
vsync = yes

</td></tr></table>
<ul>
<li>
Solved some bugs in the `r128' driver. Now working.
</li>
<li>
Now `mame' doesn't add any default video modes if the list
defined in the `mame.cfg' file is empty. You MUST use
`mv' to select the video modes available.
</li>
<li>
Now the required hclock/vclock specification for a LCD screen are:
:[video]
:hclock = 0
:vclock = 0
</li>
<li>
The default keys for the video mode change at runtime are now
`,' (COMMA) and `.' (STOP) for preventing clash with the
hotrod settings.
</li>
<li>
If the exit is done by the idle timeout the exit code is !=0
</li>
<li>
Removed the complete clear of all the video memory for
problems with some NeoMagic cards (possible Segmentation
fault)
</li>
<li>
